The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet.
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.
And each cloud is compacted, gravity gets more powerful as density increases, the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud, and then, at the center of each cloud, the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees, protons start to fuse, there's a huge release of energy, and, bam!
So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us.
Behavioral finance has a long way.
Shekhar Kapur: We are the stories we tell ourselves
And the studio executives, they would say, "Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared."
Shekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?
Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water, but right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts with growers in Turkey to sell juice into Europe, and they're doing that because they want to have a product that's closer to the European market.

Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.
Imagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.
Dr. Adam Neiman.
This shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria -- what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.
But in this middle region, between 20 and 45, the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.
Kiran Bedi has a surprising resume. Before becoming Director General of the Indian Police Service, she managed one of the country's toughest prisons -- and used a new focus on prevention and education to turn it into a center of learning and meditation. She shares her thoughts on visionary leadership at TEDWomen.
That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.
So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in, which is called CAPTCHA art.
I've got another five minutes, right?

And your entire body, everything -- your hair, skin, bone, nails -- everything is made of collagen.
Garik Israelian is a spectroscopist, studying the spectrum emitted by a star to figure out what it's made of and how it might behave. It's a rare and accessible look at this discipline, which may be coming close to finding a planet friendly to life.
Brené Brown studies human connection -- our ability to empathize, belong, love. In a poignant, funny talk at TEDxHouston, she shares a deep insight from her research, one that sent her on a personal quest to know herself as well as to understand humanity. A talk to share.
Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language -- it's from the Latin word cor, meaning heart -- and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart.
A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day.

We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians.
Who of you grew up in a family business, suffered the torture? Yes, yes.
We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing.
But this is both hysterically funny -- but I think an important philosophical point, which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.
And indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED, I see we're even closer than I thought we were before.
In 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation, but I think he concentrated on the wrong things.
This is Xantus Daniel; he's a mason, just a general construction worker, not a foreman, who took one of our trainings.
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip, and they would grab hold and they would rip.
And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition, and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.
It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario, an hour and a half northeast of Toronto, and we grew up on a farm.
Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure, so a six-year-old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram.
But you just have to go to a garden center, and they're in little paper packets.
I can give you 30 examples, right now -- Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine.
Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society: what if OSHA got it wrong?
He said he got accepted into West Point, and they don't let delinquents in West Point.
Anyway, that was two years ago, and that's where my book ended.
Well, so says George W. Bush.
Let's get back to that. And the idea, too, of Jews, Christians and Muslims -- these traditions now so often at loggerheads -- working together to create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand, at least, of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world.
If you go to the safari parks on Saturn or Jupiter, you will be disappointed.
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line, and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt, and were willing to be attacked and criticized.
The government finally made a decision that "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.
Now, the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas.
Chris Anderson: David Perry. That was awesome.
And you know, I'm getting a little bit gray -- so is Ray Kurzweil, so is Eric Drexler.
And to focus too much on all the high-technology possibilities that exist.
Jargon is a huge problem when you're trying to work across disciplines, because in an engineering world, we all understand CAD and R.P. -- not in the medical world.
Well, the second part of that, soon after -- and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience, and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."
And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet Earth.
I watched her realize that, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing, she can create poems that only Charlotte can write -- about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer.
I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped, whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations.
My TED wish: there's a vital story that needs to be told, and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era.
The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us, to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all.
So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections.
This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you from dying of smallpox.
Day seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication.
In that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox.
So, how we eradicated smallpox was -- max vaccination wouldn't work.
But the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response.
Let's increase the websites that they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million.
As always, I would return to Bangalore, and often to animated discussions at friend's homes, where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings, where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid their 14-year-old maid.

John Edwards: I'd be happy to participate in one.
My first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush."
I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves -- how as a writer, I find that African writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.
Caleb Chung plays with Pleo
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.
And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores, and a lower biomass of top head, or the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers.
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows, has a really good description for this.
Jonathan Drori: The beautiful tricks of flowers
And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
Collaborator Four: I've seen everybody from Japan, Venezuela, to the States, to Knoxville, Tennessee.
A lot of athletes have this, you know, sort of invincibility.
When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections, as I sometimes do, if you analyze self-help books that are produced in the world today, there are basically two kinds.
One of many different techniques using wireless sensors.
So you photograph that in exactly the same position, and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges.
And we're also joined by Brent Lawson from Lawson Frisk Securities.
Well, amazingly, in places like India where costs are very low, that family, that three-generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery -- so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery -- but the total cost, amortized across the rest of the work, was about 150 dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education.
The design process for Charles and Ray never ended in manufacturing.

James Surowiecki: When social media became news
I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami that also were shown on blogs.

"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."
The second premise -- and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -- is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles.
When he was just 14 years old, Malawian inventor William Kamkwamba built his family an electricity-generating windmill from spare parts, working from rough plans he found in a library book.
So that's great, but again, cheap shot, right?
Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows how “power posing” -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don’t feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain, and might even have an impact on our chances for success.
So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me, "I don't -- It feels fake." Right?
Charles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.
As a starting point for discussion with the TED group, a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign.
Mitchell Besser: Mothers helping mothers fight HIV
Consider: if you needed surgery, you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?
She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client, because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status, and she was afraid to go by herself.

Satan. Satan. Satan.
And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough.
And I wanted to see -- I want to dedicate this film to my father, Homer.
But after three trips to Antarctica, I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.

Philip K. Howard: Four ways to fix a broken legal system
But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the 1960s to all these really bad values: racism, gender discrimination, pollution -- they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore.
If you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures -- which is the current system -- they would do more.
That's basically all we're going to be talking about here.
And then, of course, NASA also had a big announcement, and President Clinton gave a press conference, about this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite.
It doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up, whether it's bacteria or any other plants or animals.

This picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training, for education.
I had hoped my voice would be saved, but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it.
That was the start of my journey to make this film, "Toxic Baby."
We already know that chemicals like DDT and DES and atrazine can also pass over into milk, again, affecting our babies even after their born.
Neither one of them had noticed that there was a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into.
This three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar, made by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.
Richard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.
Terrorists, they're rational.
So, finally -- and I'm about out of time -- the target that shapes you -- here's what's different about people. We have the same needs, but are you a certainty freak? Is that what you value most, or uncertainty? This man here couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love? We all need all six, but whatever your lead system is, tilts you in a different direction.
So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg.
It was divided into ten very simple themes -- love, anger, sadness and so on -- each of which contained a single, very open-ended question put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
So, if we want to, let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.
Accepting his 2008 TED Prize, physicist Neil Turok speaks out for talented young Africans starved of opportunity: by unlocking and nurturing the continent's creative potential, we can create a change in Africa's future.
And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa: that all of the aid that's been given has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet.
Among them will be not only brilliant scientists -- I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS -- they'll also be the African Gates, Brins and Pages of the future.
Researcher Kwabena Boahen is looking for ways to mimic the brain's supercomputing powers in silicon -- because the messy, redundant processes inside our heads actually make for a small, light, superfast computer.
With new data from the Keck telescopes, Andrea Ghez shows how state-of-the-art adaptive optics are helping astronomers understand our universe's most mysterious objects: black holes. She shares evidence that a supermassive black hole may be lurking at the center of the Milky Way.
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues, like gripping ones of culture, such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality.
The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."
It's not as if J.J. and Jill actually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up," but they might as well have.
Christopher Makau: Hi. My name is Christopher Makau.
Politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are, rather than as they would like them to be.
It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.
It's something of an Internet typology pattern, so you can have a series of these neighborhoods.
A third of the size of the basking shark is their liver, and it's full of oil.
If you look at nucleotide diversity, which is more genetics that are passed on through parents, you can see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study, was an order of magnitude less diversity than other shark species.
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction.
So this anthropologist, John Watson, found 23 cultures that had two bits of data.
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising.

Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't, except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.
We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive, but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music, want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works, how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments, like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers, Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm, and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends, who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing -- and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it, you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button, it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.
So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera.
In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece, completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement, that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise, very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.
The last thing I'll show you, the last behavioral time machine, is something that I created with Hal Hershfield, who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project, Bill Sharpe.
And here's an example from Thailand where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much -- it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured -- compared to its value as a shrimp farm, which is more like $9,600, there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms.
That was in the early 2000s when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth as the means forward -- looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent and wondering, why can we do the same?
Richard Feynman was a very complex man.
We were up in the mountains, and Feynman said to me, he said, "Leonardo."

He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, was working at the University of Washington, and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.
Before that, they were all soft, fluffy structures.
So basically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago, so why does everyone care about someone going to Facebook here and there, or Twitter here and there, or YouTube here and there?
They also write them in Hindi.
The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort, and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight, Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.
So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.
Cynthia and I were there.
I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.
Jacek Utko is an extraordinary Polish newspaper designer whose redesigns for papers in Eastern Europe not only win awards, but increase circulation by up to 100%. Can good design save the newspaper? It just might.
They're using Pragmatic Chaos now.
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking, which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution, less time wasted, and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States.
This page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web, and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place.
And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share which is basically, you take an abstract term, and you search Google for that term, and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.
And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So -- you can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.
So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.
We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville, where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.
Allan Jones: A map of the brain
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders, you give your money to Partners In Health, and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber, and they'll helicopter things out and in.

EB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.
The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering," so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.
Wouldn't it be nice, I think, when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts, just a little, and violently blushes.
Photographs do more than document history -- they make it. At TED University, Jonathan Klein of Getty Images shows some of the most iconic, and talks about what happens when a generation sees an image so powerful it can't look away -- or back.
Karen Thompson Walker: What fear can teach us
Elizabeth Pisani: Sex, drugs and HIV -- let's get rational

So, what I thought I'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel -- is, what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction.
Alright Gordon, come on, eh.
You see, a lot of the people that I most admire, they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers, they're left-handed.
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, dew point, and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout.
Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know, the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with.
We are now replicating this in a 1.75-million-square-feet building, which will have 60,000 indoor plants.

In the Summer of Love, in 1967, two million people, children, died of smallpox.
Now, in fact, by a complete fluke, I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity, and to my utter amazement, I found traces -- very strong traces, I must say -- of order in that roughness.
I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature.
So really, what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon, but a guar with cow mitochondria, and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA, and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA.
Baba Shiv: Sometimes it's good to give up the driver's seat
In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.

People came to study our reefs from Australia, which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs.
It was opening night, naturally.
"What is the objective of the consumer?"
